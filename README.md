# My name is Kendall Robinson. I am becoming a great software engineer. The class I am in is a very knowlegeable environment and fast paced.
## I am from Macon GA. A place where there isn't much of a way out to become a better person.
**But i made it out**
*Cause God has something in store for me.*
